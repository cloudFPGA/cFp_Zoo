This file is a guard for handle_vivado.tcl and should prevent the failure of a build process
becuase the make target monolithic_debug is called but the debug nets aren't defined in
<Top>/TOP/xdc/debug.xdc .
This must be done once manually in the Gui and then write YES in the last line of this file.
(It must stay the last line...)

Have you defined the debug nets etc. in <Top>/xdc/debug.xdc?
YES
